[WEBSITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION]

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Carnegie Institution for Science, where I work with Dr. Devaki Bhaya and Arthur Grossman on Phototaxis.  Prior to Carnegie, I obtained a Bachelor and M.Res from the University of Cambridge (UK), as well as a PhD in Plant Microbiology from the University of Cambridge (UK) where I was lucky to be supervised by Professor Alison Smith.

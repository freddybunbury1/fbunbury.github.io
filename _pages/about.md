I am a Postdoctoral researcher working in Arthur Grossman and Devaki Bhayaâ€™s lab at the Carnegie Institution for Science, Department of Plant Biology, at Stanford. __My research focuses on how biofilm communities of thermophilic bacteria in Yellowstone hot springs have coevolved to thrive in such extreme environments.__ During my PhD at Cambridge University in Alison Smith's lab, I studied the metabolic consequences of vitamin B12 deprivation in microalgae, and their mutualistic relationships with B12-producing bacteria.

I am a Postdoctoral fellow working in Arthur Grossman and Devaki Bhayaâ€™s lab at the Carnegie Institution for Science Department of Plant Biology on the Stanford Campus. My research focuses on how biofilm communities of thermophilic bacteria in Yellowstone hot springs have coevolved to thrive in such extreme environments. In my PhD at Cambridge University, I studied the metabolic consequences of vitamin B12 deprivation in microalgae, and their mutualistic relationships with B12-producing bacteria.

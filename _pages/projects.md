* __How do cells move and physically interact to construct dynamic biofilms?__\\
__<span style="color: grey;">   Collaborators: Andrey Malkovskiy, Victoria Calatrava, Carlos Rivas, SLAC scientists (Lydia-Marie Joubert and others), EMSL scientists (Amar Parvate and others). </span>__ \\

Weâ€™re using time lapse video microscopy to image motile cells and particle tracking algorithms to determine how they respond to changing stimuli. At the collective level we are interested in how cells of different species cooperate physically and how that alters the biofilm-like structures that they form. At the subcellular level, and with the help of scientists at SLAC and an EMSL exploratory grant, we are investigating the physical interactions between cells and the structures used for motility and cell attachment.

## Work experience

* __September 2019 - Present : Postdoctoral Researcher__\\
__<span style="color: grey;">   Carnegie Institution for Science, *Stanford, California, USA* </span>__ \\
    The goal of my research is to understand the dynamics of microbial communities consisting of interacting and coevolving species well enough to be able to model how they would respond to abiotic or biotic perturbations. I will be working with microbial communities and isolates from hot spring mats in Yellowstone NP and collaborating with biologists, physicists and computer scientists, primarily from Cambridge and Stanford.

* __April 2020 -  August 2021  :  Founder and Project leader for CODI__\\
__<span style="color: grey;"> Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), *London, United Kingdom*</span>__ \\
During the COVID-19 quarantine, as labs were shut and experiments stalled, I started and led a team at the MIT COVID Hackathon that focused on leveraging rapid antibody/antigen testing with additional patient information to increase diagnostic accuracy. Following our win, I pushed this project further, by including more people (statisticians, developers, doctors) and developing the idea. Our proposed solution led us to win three more data challenges with prizes over 100,000 dollars, and publish two papers (one on the methodology, and one on its application to the management of large events). The Rshiny app we created was integrated and maintained by a testing company (CERTIFIC).

* __June 2017 -  August 2017  : Research Intern__\\
__<span style="color: grey;"> Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), *London, United Kingdom*</span>__ \\
I spent 3 months trying to understand and address the problem of global folate deficiency. I created a model that significantly improved upon the process of estimating how many births with Neural Tube defects could be averted in different regions by mandating folic acid fortification of cereal grains, and therefore could help GAIN prioritise their efforts.

* __September 2016 -  November 2016  : Development i-Teams advisor__\\
__<span style="color: grey;">The Center for Global Equality, *Cambridge, United Kingdom* </span>__ \\
I advised and participated in an investigation into the feasibility of tackling vitamin B12 deficiency in developing countries by farming and processing microalgae in coculture with bacteria. I conducted interviews with directors of commercial algae cultivation companies, and nutrition charities. As a team we summarised our findings in the form of an oral presentation to a broad audience, as well as a written report to advise researchers where their technology could be best applied.

## Teaching


* __January 2017-March 2018: Supervisor__
  * University of Cambridge, UK
  * I tutored first-year Trinity undergraduates in the Physiology of Organisms course for the Lent term of 2017 and 2018. This was a very rewarding experience in teaching some of the most enthusiastic and able students about comparative animal and plant physiology.
  
## Miscellaneous

* Captain of the Pentathlon team
* Pole Vaulting

## Work experience

* __September 2019 - Present : Postdoctoral Researcher__\\
__<span style="color: grey;">   Carnegie Institution for Science, *Stanford, California, USA* </span>__ \\
    The goal of my research is to understand the dynamics of microbial communities consisting of interacting and coevolving species well enough to be able to model how they would respond to abiotic or biotic perturbations. I will be working with microbial communities and isolates from hot spring mats in Yellowstone NP and collaborating with biologists, physicists and computer scientists, primarily from Cambridge and Stanford.

* __June 2017 -  August 2017  : Research Intern__\\
__<span style="color: grey;"> Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), *London, United Kingdom*</span>__ \\
I created a model to calculate the health impacts, specifically the reduction in prevalence of Neural tube defects (NTDs), resulting from mandatory folic acid fortification of cereal grains. This allowed me to estimate the total number of global NTD cases that could be averted, and in which countries the coverage and impact of fortification was likely to be greatest

* __September 2016 -  November 2016  : Development i-Teams advisor__\\
__<span style="color: grey;">The Center for Global Equality, *Cambridge, United Kingdom* </span>__ \\
I advised and participated in an investigation into the feasibility of tackling vitamin B12 deficiency in developing countries by farming and processing microalgae in coculture with bacteria. I conducted interviews with directors of commercial algae cultivation companies, and nutrition charities. As a team we summarised our findings in the form of an oral presentation to a broad audience, as well as a written report to advise researchers where their technology could be best applied.

## Teaching


* __January 2017-March 2018: Supervisor__
  * University of Cambridge, UK
  * I tutored first-year Trinity undergraduates in the Physiology of Organisms course for the Lent term of 2017 and 2018. This was a very rewarding experience in teaching some of the most enthusiastic and able students about comparative animal and plant physiology.
  
## Miscellaneous

* Captain of the Pentathlon team

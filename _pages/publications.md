I am intrigued by the metabolic and physical interactions between environmental microbes. I have worked with algae from Antarctica to cyanobacteria in the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park. Nutrient exchange underpins most symbioses and I have focused on the transfer of vitamin B12 from bacteria to algae in return for photosynthate. However, physical associations are also a crucial facet of symbioses and I'm currently working on how motility and cellular interactions build biofilm structure. Going forward I am exploring how microbial communities, and particularly their keystone species, may acclimate and adapt to changing temperatures.

During the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, I worked with statisticians and medical doctors from the University of Chicago, University of California Santa Barbara, and Imperial College London on two COVID-related projects. The first project sought to improve the accuracy of COVID diagnoses by combining lateral flow assays with questionnaire results ([enriching antigen testing]()). The second devised a framework and user-friendly tool to estimate COVID transmission risk at live events ([management of live events]()).

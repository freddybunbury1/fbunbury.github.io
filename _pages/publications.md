My research has focused on two main aspect of microbial communities: Vitamin B-12 and nutrient kinetics, and     Phototaxis as part of my Postdoctoal work at Carnegie.

During the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, I got involved in two COVID-related projects (on  using questionnaire data for  [enriching antigen testing](), as well as for the [management of live events]()), with researchers at the University of Chicago, University of California Santa Barbara, as well as Imperial College London.

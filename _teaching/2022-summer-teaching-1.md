Dr. Victoria Calatrava and I designed a research project with Alicia Sanoyca, an undergraduate from UCLA. Alicia will be investigating physical interactions between Synechococcus and Chloroflexus as well as the motility of these species. We hope that Alicia will enjoy the experience and learn a lot about microbiological research during the summer internship.

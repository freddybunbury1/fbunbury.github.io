The BioBUDS course was a new course at Stanford for Building Up Developing Scientists, particularly for people with minimal research experience and underrepresented backgrounds. Ronan Esperanza was a great mentee who worked hard and displayed a good deal of scientific creativity during the 10-week program. We worked together on understanding more about the way in which thermophilic cyanobacteria respond dynamically to changing light intensity and quality. Ronan produced a fantastic presentation on his work which drew the attention of many of his peers.
